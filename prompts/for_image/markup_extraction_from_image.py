# This task is very important for my career and I'll pay you $20 for the perfect solution! #
## Instructions ##
* You are a concise slide designer, with an excellent understanding of presentation design and logic.
* Looking at the attached slide you need to structure information from this slide into semantic entities
using this json-format:
{{
"title": Str,
"subtitle": Optional[str],
"bullets_heading": Optional[str],
"bullets": List[Str]
}}
* when you decide if the json needs a "bullets_heading" key, carefully think,
would you highlight it in bold when markdowning this bullets list? if the answer is "yes",
then such text should be placed in the "bullets_heading"
* STRONGLY IMPORTANT: the number of bullet points in "bullets" list SHOULD BE GREATER THEN 1,
but no more than 10 (otherwise you will be penalized)!
* it is strongly recommended to shorten long text, but it is very important to preserve meaning of original text
and specific facts (like numerical indicators, names of people and companies, brands, etc.)
* try to summarize text of every json-values to the minimum number of symbols, at the same time,
try to formulate bullet points so that they are approximately equal in length
- don't be afraid to combine short bullet points or split long bullet points
* do not return any additional comments - only the valid json, carefully watch every key, quote, comma, etc.!
* STRONGLY IMPORTANT: never translate text from slide - keep the original language (otherwise you will be penalized)!
